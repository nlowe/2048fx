## 2048fx
A JavaFX implementation of the game [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) by Gabriele Cirulli.

### Building
You will need Java 8, which should come with JavaFX. If you have [apache ant](https://ant.apache.org)
you can use the included build script, which will create `2048fx.jar` and run it for you:

```
ant run
```

If you're on mac or windows, you'll likely have to edit `jdk.home.1.8` in `2048fx.properties` to point to
a JDK 8 installation.

### Roadmap

- [x] Ability to play the game
- [x] Help Menu
- [x] Saving / Loading games
- [x] A sensible theme
- [x] Animations
- [ ] And much more!
